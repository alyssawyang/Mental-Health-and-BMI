The first part of this project is a study that aims to utilize surveys from the NHANES 2013-2014 dataset to analyze the effects of certain demographic factors on depression and body mass index. Through the use of cross-validation, LDA and QDA models, and lasso and ridge regression, we were able to build models to aid in the early detection of depression and the understanding of what factors influence body mass index.

The second part of this study is a Kaggle competition concerning a (fictional) study that seeks to understand the ingredients that influence student performance on a standardized test of US History. In order to build a model that depicts how a student's self-evaluation, teacher-evaluation, district, and SRP blood concentration measurements influence their performance on the standardized test. We used ordinary least squares to build a model for baseline performance, then tried a multitude of other models including using lasso and ridge regression where we utilized feature engineering, random forest and averaging the SRP values, and finally tuning the hyperparameters.
